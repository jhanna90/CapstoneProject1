# Functionality to add later:
I want to add a User profile so that Users can update and change their information. For Users, I'd also like to create a "Create A Character" section where a user can create an Avatar character and add it to the database. This creation section will allow a user to create a whole character and background story to be like that character has been there all along.

I'd also like to add a merchandise section that showcases both mass-produced and hand-crafted fan art of the show. I wouldn't update the site to handle transactions but the merchandise section would be a linked page so that when a User clicks on some merchandise they are redirected to the website that is hosting that listing and the User can buy it from there or not. 

I also want to update some of the styling for the website and add custom fonts that resemble the fonts used in the show. 

I also want to add more information about the Avatar universe. Right now the site only focuses on 'Avatar: The Last Airbender,' but eventually, I want it to include information about the Avatar content that has been produced, like 'Avatar: Legend of Korra' as well as the comics and graphic novels that go into more detail about the lore of the Avatar universe.
